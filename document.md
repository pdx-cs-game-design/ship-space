# Ship Space
Bart Massey 2023

Ship Space is a game directly inspired by the 1970s arcade
game Space War. The player(s) drive 2D combat spaceships in
a top-down vector graphics environment with very limited
controls. The playfield will wrap, the ship(s) shoot bullets
out the front, a flame in the back indicates
thrusters. Physics is 2D Newtonian but with small "space
friction".

## Plan

* Install pygame and get a basic vector graphics framework
  up: 30m

* Implement spaceship physics: 30m

* Break 10m

* Optional; Implement AI opponent: 30m
